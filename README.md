DESCRIPTION:
This project demonstrates a movie/item recommendation system using two approaches:
The system works on a synthetic userâ€“item ratings dataset, split into training and test sets per user. MF predicts ratings by learning latent user/item factors, while Item-CF recommends based on similarity to items the user has rated.

**Features:**

* Synthetic dataset creation (configurable size/density).
* Bias-aware MF model with RMSE monitoring.
* Item-CF with top-K similar items.
* Evaluation metrics: RMSE, Precision\@K, Recall\@K.
* Example top recommendations per user.
